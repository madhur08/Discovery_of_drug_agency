Some external source has suggested that there are K different drug agencies with several people part of multiple agencies. The goal is to automatically uncover the various drug agencies from the telephone records. To solve this problem, we make a few assumptions.

2. All drug agencies are very close-knit: if two people are in the same agency they must have called
each other.
3. People donâ€™t directly call anyone outside their agency.
4. No agency is a strict subsidiary of another agency.
